  "text": "A quarter of dozens of British lawmakers standing down before December’s general election have complained explicitly in resignation statements about a toxic atmosphere in parliament or in politics generally.Two MPs – both women – specifically singled out the abuse and threats they have endured as a principal reason for deciding not to seek re-election.Many others have clashed with or left the party they stood for as recently as 2017, or denounced a climate of intolerance. It is clear that abuse and intimidation including death threats, divisions over Brexit, party splits, and a sense that politics is broken have all emerged as key characteristics of the last parliamentary session.By Friday (November 1), 59 politicians had announced they would be standing down – nearly 10% of the total number of MPs. Of those, 18 (30%) are women. This is broadly in line with the proportion of women in parliament as a whole (32%).Their time spent as an MP varies widely: Scottish Tory Bill Grant will only have served two years in parliament, having promised to complete only one term, whereas the Father of the House Kenneth Clarke has clocked up almost half a century in the House of Commons.Euronews has examined in detail the reasons given by those who have decided to call it a day.‘Quite frankly we’ve had enough’The two women to link abuse most directly to their decision to stand down were both elected as Conservatives in 2015.Heidi Allen, who left the Tories earlier this year and is now a Liberal Democrat, announced this week that she was leaving parliament.“I am exhausted by the invasion into my privacy and the nastiness and intimidation that has become commonplace,” she wrote in a letter to her constituents.“Nobody in any job should have to put up with threats, aggressive emails, being shouted at in the street, sworn at on social media, nor have to install panic alarms at home.“Of course public scrutiny is to be expected, but lines are all too regularly crossed and the effect is utterly dehumanising.”Tory MP Dame Caroline Spelman has taken a high-profile stance against a no-deal Brexit. Fearful for thousands of jobs in their constituencies, earlier this year she joined forces with Labour’s Jack Dromey to try to force a delay to the UK’s exit from the EU if there was no agreement.“Myself, my family and my staff, have borne an enormous brunt of abuse and I think quite frankly we’ve had enough,” she said when announcing her decision to stand down in September.“The anonymity the internet allows people to say things which if they said it to your face or they wrote it down, would not be legal.”Violent threats ‘commonplace’A recent parliamentary report found that violent threats against MPs had become “commonplace”, while an Amnesty International report in December 2018 found that 7.1% of tweets to female journalists and politicians in a study of 228,000 tweets contained abusive or problematic language.Catherine Anderson, chief executive of the Jo Cox Foundation – named after the Labour MP murdered in 2016 – told the Press Association: “One of Jo’s great passions was encouraging more women to come forward as candidates, so it is very sad to see talented women standing down at this time.”She added that “while abuse and intimidation directed at those in public life is always abhorrent”, evidence collected by the foundation showed “women are disproportionately more likely to be targets”.“We all have a responsibility to call out threats and unacceptable behaviour, whether online or offline,” she said.At least 15 politicians who are now standing down – 10 men and five women – have cited the toxic nature of today’s politics in statements explaining their decisions, even though this was not given as the primary reason for their departure.Here is a selection of their comments:Nicky Morgan (Con) cited the impact on her family and “the abuse for doing the job of a modern MP.Alan Duncan (Con) said the job was now “courser and ruder” than when he became an MP in 1992.David Lidington (Con), former deputy prime minister, tweeted to complain of “the abuse which disfigured national political debate”.Sir Nicholas Soames (Con) said parliament had become a “rougher, courser place”.Mark Field (Con) condemned a “fractious, febrile and deeply divisive aftermath to the EU referendum in 2016”.Nick Hurd (Con) previously said he intended to serve “for as long as my constituents continued to elect me” – but his announcement in September that he was standing down said: “politics is now dominated by the ongoing division over Brexit”.Sir Norman Lamb (Lib Dem) described today’s politics as “in a very sad and disturbing place”.Alia Middleton, a politics lecturer at the University of Surrey, told Euronews it was difficult to pin down factors such as intimidation and abuse as the reason for the departure of dozens of politicians at this year’s election.“I think it is difficult to get something tangible on whether there are greater numbers of MPs leaving because they can’t hack it, as there have always been those for whom politics has been more brutal, more difficult, less interesting than they expected,” she said. “Maybe what we are seeing in 2019 is MPs are more comfortable in vocalising this?”Many other politicians who are standing down, however, sign off describing their parliamentary experience as having been thoroughly rewarding. At least one contests the idea that today’s political atmosphere has reached an all-time low.One Welsh MP, Conservative Glyn Davies, said he had only good memories of this three parliamentary terms. “People are talking about the nastiness of being an MP at the moment but there have been worse times, such as during the miners’ strike. That was a really bad time,” he told the Shropshire Star.Conservative MP Ken Clarke is seen at the House of Commons in London, Britain October 30, 2019.©UK Parliament/Jessica Taylor/Handout via REUTERSA ‘broken parliament’Several departing politicians refer to the parliamentary stalemate that has produced three delays but no definitive outcome over Brexit, nearly three and a half years since the referendum.“Brexit has broken our politics,” Heidi Allen wrote in her resignation letter. “While Parliament has been in purgatory, we have legislated for almost nothing, changed almost nothing and improved almost nothing. I became an MP because I wanted to make a difference, but while Brexit continues to captivate Parliament, that just hasn’t been possible.”Former Conservative minister and leadership candidate Rory Stewart told ITV Border: “The reason I’m stepping down is … because of this place (parliament). I think that it’s, unfortunately, becoming a pretty outdated, inefficient institution. I think it’s a talking shop, people don’t listen very much … they find it very difficult to get stuff done. I felt in some ways quite ashamed … I felt I wasn’t able to represent people in the way that I wanted or respond as well as I would have liked to local concerns.”Intolerance and party splitsNo fewer than 12 of those standing down – a fifth of the total – are no longer in the party they stood for in 2017. Several more are still in the fold, but since the last election, have clashed with their party leadership over policy – especially on Brexit.Among the Conservatives, Jo Johnson – the prime minister’s brother – announced in September that he was leaving politics at the next election, saying he was “torn between family loyalty and the national interest” and describing an “unresolvable tension”.Sir Nicholas Soames wondered what his grandfather Winston Churchill would have made of the extent to which Boris Johnson’s government aims to cut loose from the EU.“I think he would have been surprised that Britain, that has always been a country that played a very big role in the world, would throw in all its chips with America, separate itself from an enormous market and… a still very influential European Union, and start to make its way alone in the world,” he told the BBC. “Why you would disconnect it in a very big way, I think he would have found puzzling.”Another outgoing Tory MP, Mark Prisk, lamented “the rise of narrow ideology over pragmatic, common sense”.However, the opposition Labour Party has also had its share of internal strife. Fundamental divisions over Brexit have led to criticism that its policy is at best ambiguous, while the party has been plagued by accusations of anti-Semitism.Louise Ellman, who is Jewish, resigned from the Labour Party in October after 55 years. “Under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, anti-Semitism has become mainstream in the Labour Party,” she wrote in her resignation letter. “Jewish members have been bullied, abused and driven out. Antisemites have felt comfortable and vile conspiracy theories have been propagated.”“The lack of tolerance for different viewpoints in the Labour Party frankly worries me,” Gloria de Piero said when announcing in July her decision to stand down. “When I hear people being called right-wing in the Labour Party I find it utterly offensive.”Helen Jones, who confirmed this week her decision not to stand again, has written recently that women Labour MPs face a culture of “bullying and harassment in their constituency parties”.Are more politicians standing down than before?The 59 politicians who have announced they are standing down is far fewer than the 149 lawmakers who quit ahead of the 2010 election, in the wake of the previous year’s expenses scandal.But this election comes only two and a half years after the last one in June 2017 – and the number of MPs voluntarily leaving their jobs is double the 30 politicians who stood down then, two years after the previous election in 2015.The 2015 election saw 90 MPs stand down, five years after the previous vote. The same tally – 90 – has now been reached in the four and a half years since then.“To put this into context, (the number) standing down at this election… is far more than I would expect,” Alia Middleton of the University of Surrey told Euronews. “The largest group of these (14) are those first elected in 2010. So it would be true to say that we are seeing MPs leaving the Commons in 2019 at an earlier stage of their career than in previous elections. This also means that these are often prominent figures.”Looking ahead, she predicted a period of political instability and uncertainty – which she said may have played a role in some MPs’ decisions to quit.“I think some of the MPs stepping down are doing so due to the uncertainty about whether they can win their seat... The uncertain political times mean that the normal rules about who is safe and who isn’t may not apply. And I think there is a deep desire for an MP to step down rather than run the risk of an undignified exit on a stage on election night.”",

  "text": "Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage will not stand in the UK election on December 12, choosing instead to campaign countywide against Prime Minister Boris Johnson's EU divorce deal.Farage, who has been an MEP since 1999 - until December 2018 with UKIP - confirmed that he would not run as an MP.Farage has tried and failed to join the British parliament on no less than seven occasions, in five general elections and two by-elections. In his last run in South Thanet in 2015 he lost by just 3,000 votes.\"I have thought very hard about this: How do I serve the cause of Brexit best?\" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr on Sunday.\"Do I find a seat and try to get myself into parliament or do I serve the cause better traversing the length and breadth of the United Kingdom supporting 600 candidates, and I've decided the latter course is the right one.\"\"We will explain to people why Boris' Brexit is a betrayal of the hopes of 17.4 m,\" he added on Twitter, with reference to those who voted to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum.On Friday, Johnson rejected an election pact with the Brexit Party.Nigel Farage had offered to build an electoral alliance with the Tories if they dropped Johnson's exit deal with the EU and allowed the UK to crash out without an agreement.Launching his Brexit Party’s general election campaign, the former UKIP leader told the UK’s prime minister he must “drop the deal, because it is not Brexit,” warning him his party would stand candidates in every seat in the country if he didn’t do so.The Brexit Party claims to have 115,000 signed up members, each of which paying £25, and has been raising funds with disaffected Tory donors.Read more: What is it like to be a Brexit Party MEP in the heart of the EU?The party swept the polls at the May elections for the European Parliament, with 29 MEPs elected.It was polling as high as 13% nationally earlier this year, but polls on Sunday suggested that support may have dropped as low as 7% amidst a growing weariness with Brexit with the British electorate.Despite its support, the Brexit Party will struggle to gain parliamentary seats due to the UK's first-past-the-post system, which beneits incumbent, major parties such as Labour and the Conservatives. Back in 2015, UKIP won 13% of the national vote but only one parliamentary seat.As a result, Johnson and the Conservatives have warned Tory voters that if they vote for the Brexit Party they risk helping Jeremy Corbyn and Labour win on December 12.Farage, alongside 28 other Brexit Party MEPs, earns a salary of €8.757,70 before tax as an MEP, plus expenses of around €4,500. That compares to €7,666 received by a British Member of Parliament, although MPs are also able to claim expenses for running an office and living in London.",

  "text": "Nicola Sturgeon has called for independence to prevent Scotland being “ripped from her European family” against its will.Scotland’s First Minister and the leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP) told a thousands-strong crowd in Glasgow that the election on December 12 was “the most important in our lifetimes” before holding a sign saying ‘Yes’, signifying a vote for independence for Scotland.Sturgeon, who does not sit as an MP in Westminster as she is a Minister for the Scottish Parliament,  also criticised both the Conservative and Labour parties.She said Boris Johnson “has his strings pulled by Donald Trump” while the Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn “cannot even make up his mind where it stands on the question of Brexit\".\"My friends, the better alternative, the much better alternative for our country is to take our future into our hands,” she said.Scotland held a referendum on independence in 2014, which the ‘No’ campaign won with 55.3% of the vote.Despite the result, the SNP — which campaigns for independence — swept the polls in Scotland in the 2015 general election, all but wiping out Labour north of the border and going from six seats in the House of Commons to 56.In the snap election of 2017, the SNP lost 21 seats, bringing its number in the Commons down to 35.Second referendumThe SNP is campaigning for a second referendum on Scottish independence, arguing that Britain’s disorderly exit from the European Union is rejected by the majority of Scots, 62% of which voted remain in the 2016 Brexit referendum.There have been suggestions that should Labour or the Liberal Democrats manage to take seats from the Conservatives in next month’s election, the SNP could enter a coalition that would hold a referendum on a Brexit deal - or on stopping Brexit altogether.But the party has openly stated its intention to mop up the remainder of Scotland’s Westminster seats, including East Dunbartonshire, where Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson has a majority of just 6,000.In September, Sturgeon won an award in Germany for being a \"voice of reason\" on Brexit.In her speech, she said: \"Scotland is and I think always will be a European nation, a committed supporter of the European Union.\"",

  "text": "Britain orders immediate moratorium on fracking due to earth tremor concernsBritain will impose an immediate moratorium on fracking, the government announced on Saturday, saying the industry risked causing too much disruption to local communities through earth tremors.Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government had previously signalled its support for the shale gas industry as it seeks ways to cut Britain's reliance on imports of natural gas which is used to heat around 80% of Britain's homes.But fracking, which involves extracting gas from rocks by breaking them up with water and chemicals at high pressure, is fiercely opposed by environmentalists who say it is at odds withBritain's commitment to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Saturday's announcement comes as Johnson gears up for an election on Dec. 12.\"Exploratory work to determine whether shale could be a new domestic energy source in the UK ... has now been paused - unless and until further evidence is provided that it can be carried out safely here,\" the business and energy department said in a statement.The decision follows a report on an incident at a site run by British energy company Cuadrilla near Blackpool, northern England where a 2.9-magnitude tremor shook houses in August.An anti-fracking campaign by local people emerged as a flashpoint in a growing climate activist movement opposing new fossil fuel projects around the world. Hundreds of protesters have been arrested over the past few years for trying to disrupt Cuadrilla's operations.\"The toll this has taken on our lives is immeasurable,\" said Maureen Mills, from Halsall Against Fracking. \"The industry is all about itself and its shareholders. Our communities are left physically and mentally drained and devastated. For what?\"Campaigners resisting a vastly larger fracking industry in the United States also cheered Britain's decision. \"This is a major step in our global struggle against fracking,\" said Xiuhtezcatl Martinez, 19, youth director of climate justice group Earth Guardians, who has been opposing the industry in his home state of Colorado for almost a decade.Fracking in England only resumed last year after two tremors prompted a seven-year moratorium.The Blackpool incident was examined by the Oil and Gas Authority (OGA), which regulates and promotes Britain's oil and gas industry.Its report found it was not currently possible to predict accurately the probability or magnitude of earthquakes linked to fracking operations.The energy department said it will not take forward proposed planning reforms for shale gas developments.\"After reviewing the OGA's report into recent seismic activity ... it is clear that we cannot rule out future unacceptable impacts on the local community,\" Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom said.Other sources of natural gas would continue to contribute to Britain's energy mix, she added. Cuadrilla is 47.4% owned by Australia's AJ Lucas, while a fund managed by Riverstone holds a 45.2% stake. There was no immediate comment from the company.",

  "title": "Criminalised and chastised: the brutal reality of seeking asylum in the UK ǀ View",
  "text": "Since the 2016 EU referendum, the UK has become notorious for harbouring a contemptuous approach to immigration. In a 2018 briefing, the Migration Observatory found that British people held a ‘clear opposition’ to immigration, with 58% voting in favour of reducing the number of immigrants coming to the UK. In a 2017 sample of those surveyed online, the briefing found just 10% believed that ‘no Australians should be allowed to come and live in Britain’ - compared with 37% who felt that no Nigerians should be allowed.This preference for one ‘type’ of migrant over another alludes to an unnerving truth. In favouring migrants with a ‘cultural likeness’ - typically white, English-speaking and from European and/or Christian countries – it is those at the opposite end of the scale – namely non-white and from Muslim countries – who are left to bear the brunt of such hostility.It’s no surprise that a country ranked one of the worst destinations across Western Europe for those seeking asylum exudes such xenophobic ideology. One crucial component spurring the nation’s disdain towards immigration is the continuous depiction of migrants, and particularly those seeking asylum, as criminals.Just last month, discussions were underway between the new UK Home Secretary, Priti Patel, and the Minister of the Interior for France, Christophe Castaner, regarding what more could be done to deter migrants from making the treacherous journey across the Channel. It was reported that the UK would consider increasing financial support in a joint effort with France to ‘tackle’ boat crossings.Patel’s antagonistic rhetoric neglects to acknowledge that seeking asylum is a right enshrined within international law. Yet it has historically been presented to the public as an invasion which leaves citizens at risk. Aided by the media's portrayal of ‘illegal immigrants’ sweeping the nation, the truth is both silenced and clouded by an explosive politics of fear.Those seeking asylum are not entering the country ‘illegally’ when they arrive at the UK border. This is, in fact, an essential part of the process. To claim asylum in Britain, you must do so once you have arrived to the UK. This leaves those desperately fleeing war, violence or persecution attempting to reach the country by any means possible. The very fact that they would risk their lives in the process should speak volumes.Punitive policyThe entire process of claiming asylum in the UK acts as a maze to those attempting to navigate it; a bureaucratic one-way trap that often allows for an exit only – no entrance. After making a journey that often promises critical conditions, those arriving to seek asylum in the UK are greeted with a system set on inhibiting them.From Theresa May’s hideous hostile environment policy in 2012 to the ‘Deport first, appeal later’ strategy introduced in 2014 (and later deemed unlawful), the government has consistently championed immigration policies which inevitably sway public opinion and stigmatise those seeking asylum. Innate to the concept of the ‘hostile environment’ policy was its desire to deter migrants through creating an unwelcoming environment, hoping to encourage many to return to their countries of origin. This, in itself, incriminates migrants, conveying them as something to be rid of; a social ill; encouraging segregation.DetentionThe UK’s readiness to detain even the most vulnerable of asylum seekers is of great concern to thousands of campaigners and activists who have urged for an end to indefinite detention for years. A parliamentary report found that in 2018, 61% of those in detention centres across the UK were asylum seekers. The harrowing conditions of detention have been compared to that of prison – or worse – with many left isolated, subject to both physical and mental abuse. Perhaps most abysmally, with no time limit provided on how long they will spend there; 12% of detainees are held for periods of 6 months or more. The UK is in fact the only country across Europe which allows for indefinite detention.Evictions and interceptionsIn September, UK news publications reported the mass eviction of displaced people from makeshift refugee camps in Calais, France. Unsurprisingly, the primary focus was the ‘imminent’ concern that these asylum seekers would swamp the UK border as a result of being evicted. Considered a ‘major incident’ by the Home Office, plans are underway to intercept boats travelling through the Channel. And yet, last on the agenda to be held responsible for this second-wave ‘Calais crisis’ is the asylum process itself and its disregard of asylum seekers as humans; as individuals who have a legal right to access safety.What ought to be addressed are the inhumane border policies and measures - those the UK helps to fund - leaving asylum seekers with no choice but to attempt hazardous crossings to the UK. Instead, the prime minister issued insensitive and inaccurate statements maintaining that any individuals making such a journey will be ‘sent back’.The choice to criminaliseThe exhausted political slogan and promise to ‘reduce net migration numbers’ treats migration as a disease on the decline; one the government is, slowly but surely, remedying. This constant criminalisation is a deliberate, calculated choice. The poor and widely contested claim that increased migration will lead to a further drain on the UK economy simply is not true. So far, despite the country’s supposed financial pressures, the government has managed to locate millions of pounds to contribute to security measures including the notorious ‘Great Wall of Calais’ to prevent asylum seekers from reaching the UK border.This is not to mention that holding just one person in detention costs the government £87.71 per day. Considering more than half of those detained in 2018 were simply released again, it undeniably suggests that, for the majority of detainees, detention is entirely unnecessary. Yet the government would rather splash cash on holding those seeking asylum as prisoners as opposed to aiding with their transition into society.The irony is that post-Brexit, the UK will likely see a spike in the number of individuals seeking asylum. Britain’s departure from the EU means it can no longer take advantage of the ‘Dublin Regulation’ which allows the Home Office to return asylum cases to countries it deems responsible. It is therefore essential that the government rapidly re-evaluates its priorities; evidently, spending millions on callous measures to prevent asylum claims in the UK is failing. This money could – and should – be dedicated to helping those who simply want the opportunity to live a secure and stable life. We must not turn a blind eye to those simply exercising their right to refuge.Holly Barrow is a political correspondent for the Immigration Advice Service, an organisation of UK immigration lawyers providing free advice and legal support to asylum seekers and victims of abuse____________Are you a recognised expert in your field?

  "text": "Nigel Farage has offered to build an electoral alliance with Boris Johnson if he drops his exit deal with the EU and allows the UK to crash out without an agreement.Launching his Brexit Party’s general election campaign, the former UKIP leader told the UK’s prime minister he must “drop the deal, because it is not Brexit,” warning him his party would stand candidates in every seat in the country if he didn’t do so.Boris Johnson responded in a series of interviews that he had ruled out an alliance with any other party.\"I ruled out a pact with everybody because I didn't that it's sensible to do that. We are proud of our beliefs, we're proud of our one nation conservatism,\" Johnson told Sky News.The Conservative Party is aiming to win the December 12 election by campaigning for Boris Johnson’s new deal with the EU.Farage said that currently the Brexit Party is the only party advocating for Brexit and warned Johnson not to underestimate the determination or organisation of his party.Calling on Johnson to drop the deal and instead go for a \"genuine free trade agreement\" along the lines of Canada's agreement with the EU, Farage said: \"I believe the only way to solve this is to build a leave alliance across this country. If it was done BJ would win a very big majority, and we really could get Brexit done.\"More: Why tactical voting is the talk of the UK's upcoming general electionMore: How can British expats vote in the next general election?The MEP for South East England, who has tried and failed to win a seat in Parliament seven times, was a key figure in securing a referendum and a public vote to leave the European Union.The Brexit Party wants the UK to leave the EU without a deal in place, and currently has no seats in parliament, although it does have 29 MEPs.On Thursday, Farage conducted an interview with Donald Trump on his show on a British radio station, in which the US president urged the Brexit Party to get behind Boris Johnson.Farage responded by saying he would be “right behind” Johnson, if the prime minister dropped the Brexit divorce deal he struck with the European Union two weeks ago and instead went for a “clean break” Brexit without a deal.Conservative Party Chairman James Cleverly said a vote for Farage would give Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn the keys to Downing Street and could end the chance for Brexit to even happen.\"A vote for Farage risks letting Jeremy Corbyn into Downing Street via the back door - and the country spending 2020 having two referendums on Brexit and Scottish independence,\" he said.\"It will not get Brexit done - and it will create another gridlocked parliament that doesn't work.\"You can watch the entire launch again in the video player, above.",

  "text": "ConservativesLeader: Boris Johnson | Slogan: “Get Brexit done”Less than four years ago, the Conservatives were committed to keeping Britain in the European Union — but on renegotiated terms backed by a confirmatory referendum.Two leaders, a disastrous election and several cabinet reshuffles later, the party is firmly behind Brexit.Boris Johnson wants to leave the EU under the revised deal he agreed earlier this month.The prime minister, who took over from Theresa May at the end of July, has repeatedly promised that the UK will leave Europe on October 31, \"do or die\" — but that deadline has flown past without success.European integration has been a fault line through the Conservatives for decades, but Brexit has blown the party wide open. Twenty-one of its MPs, including several former cabinet ministers and Winston Churchill’s grandson, were expelled in September failing to follow the government's line on Brexit; only ten have been allowed back to fight in this election.Brexit has caused such political upheaval that the “manifesto” tab on the Conservatives website was on Thursday still directing users to Theresa May’s disastrous 2017 campaign material.As well as a pledge to (somehow) “get Brexit done”, it is expected to promise more police — replacing officers cut under its own 2010-2015 government — and money for the NHS.Conservative Party leader Boris JohnsonLabourLeader: Jeremy Corbyn | Slogan: “It’s time for real change”After months of prevarication over Brexit, Labour has coalesced around a pledge to renegotiate Johnson's deal and put the new one to a second public vote.“A Labour government will negotiate a sensible deal within three months of being elected,” the party promised at its manifesto launch on Thursday. “It will be based on the things we have long advocated and discussed with the EU; trade unions and businesses, including a new customs union, a close single market relationship and guarantees of rights and protections.”It adds: “Labour is the only party that can and will deliver a public vote. Labour trusts the people to decide.”(Corbyn has not indicated which way he would himself vote).Labour has also been divided by Brexit, with some members fearing an electoral threat from Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party unless it commits to implementing the result of the 2016 referendum. Others in the party say it risks losing centrist, pro-EU voters to the explicitly anti-Brexit Liberal Democrats.The party will be more confident away from Brexit and on core domestic issues such as poverty, low pay and renationalising public utilities, and is likely to harness opposition to Boris Johnson and his right-wing cabinet.Jeremy Corbyn, who heads up the UK's main opposition party, LabourLiberal DemocratsLeader: Jo Swinson | Slogan: “Stop Brexit, build a brighter future.”After electoral annihilation in 2015, the party has seized upon its explicitly anti-Brexit message to win back votes from Remainers.Its clear pledge to cancel Brexit altogether by revoking Article 50 has stood in contrast to the ambiguous position of the other main parties.A string of local and by-election victories has given the Liberal Democrats a springboard to recover lost ground, with some polls suggesting the party is poised to overtake Labour into second place in many parts of England.If the party doesn’t win a majority, it would support a second referendum.Swinson has said she is open to electoral pacts with the nationalist parties in Scotland and Wales to leave some constituencies uncontested in order to avoid splitting the Remain vote.Lib Dem leader Jo SwinsonScottish National PartyLeader: Nicola Sturgeon | Slogan: “It's time to choose our own future”The Scottish National Party is anti-Brexit — reflecting Scotland’s pro-Remain vote in the 2016 referendum — and has been campaigning for a second vote on Brexit to avoid leaving the EU.It sees an opportunity to harness anger in Scotland at the prospect of leaving the EU; if Brexit goes ahead, it is likely to press quickly for another independence referendum with the ultimate aim of an independent Scotland rejoining the EU.The party is pitching itself as “escape route” from a Conservative Brexit.But while its Brexit message is popular, the SNP may face a tough fight in parts of Scotland where the Liberal Democrats or Conservatives are strong and has struggled over areas of its performance in Scotland's government.Nicola Sturgeon, leader of the Scottish National PartyBrexit PartyLeader: Nigel Farage | Slogan: “Change politics for good”The Brexit Party, formed from the wreckage of the imploding UKIP, wants the UK to leave the EU without a deal in a \"clean-break Brexit\".It was vehemently opposed to Theresa May’s agreement and says Johnson’s version still doesn’t go far enough.In particular, it would still involve paying the EU a multi-billion divorce settlement.Farage, who is expected to set out the party’s plan on Friday, has indicated willingness to form an electoral pact with the Conservatives to try to avoid splitting the Brexit vote — but only if Johnson commits to a no-deal Brexit, which seems unlikely.With significant support among Britain’s core Brexit voters, the party could, like the Liberal Democrats, prove crucial to the December 12 result.MEP and Brexit Party chief Nigel FarageThe Independent Group for ChangeLeader: Anna SoubryThis party began life earlier this year as Change UK, a refuge for pro-EU Conservative and Labour MPs who quit their party over Brexit. It has since changed its name and lost a few MPs to the Liberal Democrats.Its remaining five MPs back a second Brexit referendum.Former Conservative MP Anna SoubryGreen PartyLeaders: Jonathan Bartley & Siân Berry | Slogan: “Standing with you for a People's Vote.”The pro-EU party's solitary MP, Caroline Lucas, has been a vocal campaigner for another second Brexit referendum.

Johnson repeatedly promised Brexit would happen by October 31 saying he would rather be \"dead in a ditch\" than ask the EU for another extension.  In a video message posted on Thursday, Johnson blamed the opposition Labour party.  \"We were meant to leave the EU today, October 31st, but unfortunately the Labour opposition blocked it,\" Johnson said, although the law that required him to ask for an extension was passed due to support from rebel MPs within his own Conservative party.He then defended his call for a snap election on December 12, which passed overwhelmingly in the House of Commons on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, the Brexit party's Nigel Farage called it \"the second big broken promise from a Conservative prime minister in the same year\".

  "text": "John Bercow, the well-known speaker of the UK parliament, cried \"orderrrr!\" at MPs for the final time on Thursday.The 56-year-old was elected speaker — a powerful role requiring political impartiality — in 2009.During his decade in the chair, his art of rhetoric and theatricality have seen him go viral, star in many memes, and become one of the country's most recognisable politicians.  But his stint in the role — which involves him presiding over MPs' debates, maintaining order and choosing which parliamentarians can address the chamber — has not been without controversy. 'A great servant'British leader Boris Johnson led the tributes on Wednesday during Prime Minister Questions, saying Bercow, an avid tennis fan, had peppered \"every part of the chamber with your own thoughts and opinions like some uncontrollable tennis-ball machine\".\"Although we may disagree about some of the legislative innovations that you have favoured, there is no doubt in my mind that you have been a great servant to Parliament and to this House of Commons,\" he added.The two men have had some tense exchanges in the previous months with Bercow describing Johnson's decision to suspend parliament in early September — widely seen as a move to prevent MPs from holding him to account over his strategy to take the country out of the European Union — as a \"constitutional outrage\".\"However it is dressed up, it is blindingly obvious that the purpose of prorogation now would be to stop Parliament debating Brexit and performing its duty in shaping a course for the country,\" Bercow's statement also said.He also denied Johnson a second vote in parliament on the deal he struck with Brussels earlier this month, arguing it would be \"repetitive and disorderly\".READ MORE: John Bercow: 'Capable of great things... but he upset a lot of people along the way''Standing up for democracy'Bercow first entered the House of Commons in 1997 as a Conservative MP for Buckingham, south-eastern England. Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the main opposition Labour party, said of Bercow that he has \"given real power to backbenchers\" as he \"vastly expanded the use of urgent questions\" and \"opened up the number of emergency debates\".\"You've stood up for parliament when it has to be stood up for, and we thank you for that,\" he added.Ian Blackford, the leader of Scotland's National Party in Westminster, said his colleagues \"salute you, Sir, for the way that you have stood up for the democracy of this house.\"Fewer than 15 urgent questions — an accelerated procedure that allows all MPs not in the government to put a question to a minister — were brought forward each year in the decade preceding Bercow's election as Speaker, according to the House of Commons Library.That number shot up during his tenure with more than 70 asked every year since 2015.'Orderrrr!'But his reach vastly expanded beyond the walls of the House of Commons. According to pollster YouGov, Bercow is the third most popular \"other UK public figure\", with fans describing him as a good speaker, humourous, admirable, fair and committed.That's largely in part due to his unique way of booming out and dragging out the word \"order\" which has inspired countless memes.But he is also known for his imaginative, verbose put-downs aimed indiscriminately at backbenchers and government members, including prime ministers.The country's referendum decision to leave the EU boosted his profile further as his role saw him decide which motions and amendments could be put to a vote in a parliament increasingly divided along Remain and Leave lines.His own impartiality was called into question with Brexiteers criticising him for a \"B*llocks to Brexit\" sticker seen on his car. To which he replied: \"That sticker, on the subject of Brexit, happens to be, affixed to or in the windscreen of, my wife's car. Yes, and I'm sure the honourable gentleman wouldn't suggest for one moment that a wife is somehow the property or chattel of her husband.\"Abroad, his stance on a state visit by US President Donald Trump also made headlines. He effectively banned the US leader from addressing lawmakers in Parliament — and honour granted to Barrack Obama, Bill Clinton, and Ronald Reagan.\"As far as this place is concerned, I feel very strongly that our opposition to racism and to sexism and our support for equality before the law and an independent judiciary are hugely important considerations in the House of Commons,\" he argued.Expenses and bullyingBut his tenure has not been without other controversies.He was heavily criticised over his expenses after it was revealed that he had claimed over £31,000 (€35,900) in travel and accommodation expenses in the year to July 2015.Among the claims that raised the most eyebrows were a £172 (€199) taxi bill for a 1.1-km ride and a £980 (€1,137) receipt for a one-way drive from London to Halifax.He also found himself at the centre of a bullying scandal with his former private secretary telling the BBC's Newsnight show in May 2018 that Bercow was prone to \"over-the-top anger\".\"There was a lot of bad language and suddenly his mobile phone, which he'd been holding, was flung n the desk in front of me and broke into a lot of bits,\" he claimed.A subsequent report on abuse in Parliament found that there is a \"culture, cascading from the top down, of deference, subservience, acquiescence and silence, in which bullying, harassment and sexual harassment have been able to thrive and have long been tolerated and concealed\".Dame Laura Cox, the former judge who authored the report, added that she \"find(s) it difficult to envisage how the necessary changes can be successfully delivered, and the confidence of the staff restored, under the current senior House administration\".But Bercow, who has denied any wrongdoing, refused to step down.",

  "text": "Even by the standards of the near three and a half years since the UK’s EU referendum in 2016, October was a momentous month for Brexit.In the run-up to the scheduled date for the UK’s departure at Halloween, Boris Johnson’s government finally sealed a new exit deal with the EU – but a missed deadline in the British parliament forced the prime minister by law to seek another Brexit delay.European leaders agreed to the request for a three-month extension, while UK lawmakers finally agreed to an early general election in December to try to clear the path ahead.Here is a blow-by-blow account of the key events:October 2: More than two months after becoming prime minister, Boris Johnson tells the Conservative Party conference in Manchester he will send “constructive and reasonable proposals” for a new Brexit deal to the EU. A revised UK exit plan is duly sent to the European Commission the same day; the prime minister also writes to its president, Jean-Claude Juncker. The plan proposes an overhaul of the controversial backstop guarantee for the Irish border. It is received politely in Brussels, but the Irish prime minister says it does not “fully meet the agreed objectives of the backstop”.October 3: As EU leaders digest the UK plan, it becomes increasingly evident that it is problematic. The UK proposes a complicated system involving technology and trusted trader schemes to avoid Irish border checks. Northern Ireland will stay partially aligned to the EU single market. But a consent scheme that gives the hardline unionist DUP an effective veto goes down badly. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn calls the plan a “rehashed version” of previously rejected proposals. Northern Ireland businesses don't like it either.Read more: How did Europe react to Boris Johnson's original Brexit plan?October 4: Government papers submitted to a Scottish court say the prime minister will obey the law and ask the EU for another Brexit extension, if a parliamentary deadline for approving a new deal is missed. It contradicts Johnson’s insistence that he will not request another delay.October 5: The European Commission says the UK proposals \"do not provide a basis\" for a Brexit deal.October 8: UK-EU negotiations all but collapse amid a day of acrimony as Johnson’s office gives a negative account of a conversation with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. European Council President Donald Tusk tweets accusing Johnson of playing a “stupid blame game”. Ireland unveils a €1.2 billion fund to cope with a no-deal Brexit.October 9: Jean-Claude Juncker condemns the \"blame game from London\" in a speech to the European Parliament, but refuses to rule out a deal.October 10: British and Irish prime ministers Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar meet in northwest England for a private meeting. Suddenly the mood lifts as they announce they can see “a pathway to a possible deal”. Details remain under wraps but Donald Tusk tweets that he has received “promising signals” from the Taoiseach.Read more: Northern Ireland's violent past looms over last-ditch Brexit talksOctober 11: EU and UK negotiators Michel Barnier and Stephen Barclay meet in Brussels as both sides agree to intensify Brexit talks. The race is on to try to reach a deal by an EU summit in under a week’s time.October 13: Barnier briefs EU diplomats on Sunday and says “a lot of work remains to be done”. Johnson tells his cabinet a “significant amount of work” is needed to reach a deal. The talks continue.October 14: The Queen’s Speech takes place in the UK parliament. The monarch reads out the government’s agenda for the next parliamentary term. Critics say it is a pointless exercise, given the imminent Brexit deadline and the government’s lack of a majority.October 15: The government is dealt a blow after Northern Ireland unionists from the DUP, which has backed it in parliament until now, say they cannot support the UK Brexit plan “as things stand”.October 17: Johnson and Juncker simultaneously announce dramatically that the EU and the UK have struck a deal. It comes as EU leaders gather for a European Council summit. The agreement replaces the Irish backstop, meaning the whole of the UK will leave the EU customs union – a success for Johnson. But the PM caves in on his plan for Northern Ireland, which will have a regulatory frontier with Britain. The DUP say they will not back it. Attention switches to whether Johnson can get his deal through the UK parliament.Read more: Hearty handshakes as Boris Johnson toasts Brexit deal with EU leadersOctober 19: The House of Commons meets on a Saturday for the first time since 1982. The PM had hoped to win its backing for his deal. But MPs vote to withhold their approval until the laws to implement Brexit are in place. This means the Benn Act comes into force: because parliament has not approved a deal or a no-deal exit by this date, the PM is obliged to seek a three-month Brexit delay from the EU. Johnson duly sends a letter to Brussels but leaves it unsigned. On the same day, hundreds of thousands of people march in London for another Brexit referendum.Read more: What's in Boris Johnson's Brexit deal with the European Union?October 20: EU ambassadors meet briefly to consider the UK request. The European Commission has said it “takes note” of the UK parliamentary vote, but EU leaders make it clear they are looking to the UK to clarify its next steps.October 21: Johnson is refused permission to bring a straight “yes or no” vote on the deal to parliament. House of Commons Speaker John Bercow rules the motion was essentially the same as the one brought on Saturday. The government publishes its bill to implement the Brexit deal.Read more: What's in the Withdrawal Agreement Bill?October 22: The Commons holds its first debate on the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill. It passes its first hurdle, achieving a majority of 30 at the second reading. However, MPs reject by 14 votes the proposed three-day timetable, described as woefully inadequate for such an important matter. Boris Johnson says the government will “pause” the legislation. European Council President Donald Tusk says he will recommend that the EU27 accept the UK extension request.Read more: Why did Boris Johnson shelve his EU divorce bill after timetable defeat?October 23: Boris Johnson tells parliament he awaits the EU’s decision on a delay. Germany says it is open to a short-term extension. But France has been pushing back, saying any extension must have a good reason.October 24: Boris Johnson suddenly calls for a general election on December 12 – and sends an open letter to Jeremy Corbyn saying he will allow parliament more time to approve the exit deal if MPs back the snap poll. The European Parliament backs a \"flexible extension\" that could end before the end of January. France again calls for more clarity from Britain.Read more: Why does Boris Johnson want a December election amid the Brexit stalemate?October 25: Meeting on Friday, EU27 envoys to Brussels agree to a Brexit extension, but decide to delay a decision on the details until after the weekend.October 26: DUP leader Arlene Foster tells her party conference it cannot support the agreement as it creates a customs border in the Irish Sea. The Liberal Democrats and Scottish National Party (SNP) send a letter to Donald Tusk to say that if the EU grants an extension to January 31, 2020, they will back a general election on December 9.Read more: Is Boris Johnson telling the truth about Northern Ireland border checks?October 28: Tusk says the EU has agreed to offer the UK a Brexit “flextension” until January 31. Boris Johnson confirms that he is forced to accept it. The government stands down its no-deal Brexit preparations, and puts on hold its advertising campaign for an october 31 departure. The PM’s latest call for an early election fails in parliament. The motion passes but falls well short of the two-thirds majority needed under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act.October 29: Jeremy Corbyn lifts Labour’s opposition to an early election, arguing that the extension means a no-deal Brexit is “off the table”. The government tries again in parliament, via a bill that needs only a simple majority but runs the risk of being amended. By a large majority, MPs finally back a general election on December 12.

  "text": "The UK is set for a general election on 12 December, as the country tries to find a way past the current Brexit impasse.This election is very different from those that came before - because for many voters, it will be something of a second referendum on Brexit.What happens with Brexit after the election could depend on how many pro-Remain MPs, or pro-Leave MPs win seats.The Conservatives are campaigning on Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s new Brexit deal, agreed with the European Union.The Labour party has promised a second referendum within 100 days of the election, should it take power, and other opposition parties such as the Liberal Democrats and Scottish National Party want to stop Brexit altogether.Therefore tactical voting could play a crucial role in this election, more than any other in recent history.More: New Year's leave? Deadlocked Britain to hold snap election on December 12More: How can British expats vote in the next general election?What is tactical voting?In UK general elections voters in a constituency choose their MP, and the party that achieves a majority of MPs in Parliament wins.Tactical voting takes place because — under the UK's first-past-the-post system — some seats are only realistically contested by two or three different parties. Therefore if a voter’s desired party doesn’t have a chance in that seat, they may instead vote for a different party; one that aligns somewhat with their beliefs, or one that has the best chance of keeping some other party out.Splitting the vote is also a huge consideration. In this election, for example, Leave voters would want to avoid the risk of splitting the vote between two Leave parties in the same seat, such as the Conservatives and the Brexit Party, and therefore handing victory to a Remain candidate.How would it work?One organisation that wants to get voters voting tactically to win a pro-Remain majority in Parliament is Best for Britain, which claims it is a “cross-party campaign with a mission to stop Brexit by any democratic means”.It has set out what it believes is a roadmap to Remain victory, with a tool on its website inviting users to enter their postcode to find out who they should vote for to get the best chance of a Remain-supporting MP in that seat.The campaign predicts that if 30% of pro-Remain voters vote tactically it would prevent the Conservatives from getting a majority, and with 40% voting tactically a coalition of Labour, Liberal Democrats, SNP, Green and Plaid Cymru would hold a majority of 36 seats in Parliament.A number of other pro-Remain tactical voting apps and website have also been launched.Pro-Brexit campaign group Leave.EU has promised voters an app that will do the same on the Leave side, recommending a single pro-Brexit candidate in each constituency who will have the best chance of winning the seat.One example of a marginal seat where tactical voting could make all the difference is in the Richmond Park constituency in London. At the last election in 2017, the Conservative candidate beat the Liberal Democrat by just 45 votes. The Labour candidate came a distant third but still took more than 5,700 votes.Whether tactical voting will work in this election will remain to be seen, but a recent poll found nearly a quarter of voters were ready to vote tactically.",

  "text": "Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of Britain's main opposition Labour party, made his first major election pitch on Thursday.Corbyn's speech from Battersea, south-west London, comes after MPs this week approved legislation put forward by Prime Minister Boris Johnson to call a snap election on December 12.Johnson had previously lost three votes — which required a two-thirds majority of MPs — over whether to have a fresh poll.Before agreeing to one, opposition parliamentarians wanted assurances the country would not crash out of the European Union without a deal.They were assured when the EU agreed to extend the Brexit deadline from October 31 to January 31 to leave time for the UK parliament to ratify the new divorce deal struck between London and Brussels earlier this month.In his speech, Corbyn took Johnson to task saying he \"has failed\" to deliver on his promise that \"he would rather be 'dead in a ditch' than delay (Brexit) beyond today\".\"Labour will get Brexit sorted within six months. We'll let people decide whether to leave with a sensible deal or remain,\" Corbyn pledged.READ MORE: Brexit: why is there another delay and a UK election? | Euronews answersHe refuted the Prime Minister's claim that \"Brexit is being blocked by the establishment elite\", arguing that voters \"know the Conservatives are the establishment elite\".Corbyn also attacked the Conservatives' main campaign pledges to put more police officers on the streets and to boost funding for the National Health Service (NHS).He accused Johnson of seeking to open up the NHS as part of negotiations for a trade deal with the US and said the Conservatives — in power since 2010 — \"have slashed taxes for the richest and slashed vital services ad support for everyone else\".\"We will invest in every nation and region, rebuild our public services and give our NHS, schools and police the money they need by taxing those at the top to properly fund services to everyone,\" Corbyn said.READ MORE: How can British expats vote in the next general election? | Euronews answersIn response to his speech, the Conservatives said on Twitter that although \"Corbyn talks tough on tax avoidance\", he and Labour \"voted against 39 of our measures to tackle\" it.Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats have said that \"Labour and Conservatives are stuck in the past\" and that they \"have failed Britain\". The anti-Brexit party is campaigning to stop Brexit altogether.According to pollster YouGov's latest political tracker, carried out across Tuesday and Wednesday, the Conservatives have a 15 percentage points lead over its nearest rival, Labour.READ MORE: 'Revoluciones, Si!

  "text": "He has been one of the most controversial parliamentary speakers in modern British history, but on Thursday, John Bercow stands down after 10 years in the iconic chair.His role involves presiding over MPs' debates, maintaining order, and choosing which parliamentarians can address the chamber.Speaking on Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson served up a tennis metaphor to characterise a speaker renowned for his enthusiasm for the racket sport.Johnson said Bercow had peppered \"every part of the chamber with your own thoughts and opinions like some uncontrollable tennis-ball machine\".The MP for Buckingham has remained a contentious character in the Brexit drama. He took over with parliament’s legacy on the ropes in 2009, following his predecessors’ resignation over the expenses scandal. More recently, he has been forced to weather his own scandals relating to bullying and parliamentary conduct.Seb Whale, who is currently writing a biography on Bercow, spoke to Euronews about the legacy he leaves behind.“I think the next speaker will have to define whether Bercow has changed the role for good, and if they carry on with his interventionist ways, then it certainly will be,\" he said.\"My inkling is that the house will choose someone who is perhaps a safe pair of hands, and slightly less controversial in the wake of John Bercow.“He was a great reformer and capable of great things, but he did it often uncompromising and very controversial ways and upset a lot of people along the way.”",

  "text": "British MPs have voted to back a general election on December 12 in what would be the first December election since 1923.In both these ballots, Conservative prime ministers have looked to strengthen their leaderships after inheriting the role from early resigning predecessors — but it is the result from the former that the current PM would like to avoid.Stanley Baldwin became the UK's prime minister in 1923 after Andrew Bonar Law was diagnosed with terminal throat cancer and resigned from the post in May of that year.The UK at the time was rife with high unemployment and was dealing with ongoing issues in a post-war economy.Baldwin, who saw an answer in reforms and an introduction of trade tariffs on imports, decided to call an election on December 6 to secure his mandate.While it led to the Conservatives winning the most seats, the plan ultimately backfired on Baldwin after his opposition — the Labour Party and the Liberals — won enough seats between them to cause a hung parliament.Baldwin's Conservatives won 258 seats in the election, which is 51 seats shy of the 309 seats necessary to command an overall majority.Meanwhile, the Labour Party won 191 seats, and the Liberals 158.Despite this blow to his leadership, the prime minister did not resign immediately and instead continued to try and govern the country.But in January 1924, MPs voted against the King's Speech — which opens a new parliamentary session by setting out the government's priorities — and all but ended his premiership.It eventually went on to see the Labour Party rule with a minority government along with the UK's first Labour prime minister, Ramsay MacDonald, at the helm.It is also interesting to note that Ramsey's premiership didn't last long. A vote of no confidence in his government was carried by a large majority, leading to another election in October 1924 - which was won by the Conservatives. The UK's current Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who took the role after his predecessor Theresa May resigned in July, will look to avoid history repeating itself as he seeks a mandate amid the country's ongoing Brexit woes.",

  "text": "The UK has taken a major step towards a snap general election - but will Boris Johnson's Conservatives get the majority they need to push through Brexit?After repeated failures to get an EU divorce deal through parliament, MPs voted on Tuesday (October 30) to go back to the people.Unless the House of Lords — the UK's upper parliament — objects, the election is set to be held on Thursday, December 12.“All I would say is that today, at the end of October, we have the Conservatives well ahead [in the polls],\" Ben Page, chief executive of polling firm Ipsos Mori, told Euronews. “If you don’t want to look at the headline results at the polls, another predictive factor that has been very reliable for the last 30 or 40 years, is not people’s position in the polls at the start of the campaign but rather who is seen as the best prime minister and the best person to run the economy.”If the election is confirmed for December, it would be the first time the UK has held a vote in this month since 1923.There have been fears that the run-up to Christmas and the weather could affect turnout. But Page feels such concerns have been exaggerated. \"I do think there is a lot of folklore about the weather - it is probably less important than it sounds,\" Page said on Good Morning Europe.\"Remember millions and millions of people will not cast their votes by post so the weather will not affect them too much. \"We all have central heating now which we didn't in the 1920s and the evidence is weather affects it much less than one might imagine.\"A more relevant factor concerning whether or not the Conservatives will get the majority is perhaps Nigel Farage's Brexit Party.  Brexiters have urged Farage's movement and the Conservatives to agree on an election pact to avoid them taking votes from each other. You can watch the full report in the video player, above.",

  "text": "Boris Johnson was firmly in election mode on Wednesday, trading barbs with opponents in the last Prime Minister's Questions before a snap December 12 poll.He faced the House of Commons the day after securing an early election, aimed at ending the political deadlock over Brexit, on his fourth attempt.It was a session for the history books, lasting 71 minutes — breaking the previous record set by his predecessor, Theresa May.\"This election is a once-in-a-generation chance,\" said opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who was wearing a bright green tie in a nod to survivors and relatives of the Grenfell Tower fire.\"People have a chance to vote for real change after years of Conservative and Lib Dem cuts, privatization and tax handouts for the richest.\"Johnson agreed \"that there is a stark choice facing this country.\"He said the choice was between \"getting Brexit done and ending the dither and the delay\" if the Conservatives won, and \"economic catastrophe under the Labour Party.\"The Commons is expected to be dissolved next week, paving the way for the official election campaign to start.It follows the agreement by the European Union to delay Brexit, extending the UK’s membership until January 31, 2020.The UK and the EU agreed a revised divorce deal earlier this month. But a missed deadline to get it approved at Westminster forced Johnson by law to seek the latest Brexit delay.Johnson challenged on health and tradeIn the House of Commons, Jeremy Corbyn attacked the prime minister over the state of the British health service and asked about reports of \"secret meetings\" with US companies.Johnson accused the opposition Labour leader of anti-Americanism, asking whether Corbyn disapproved of \"negotiations to ensure British patients get the drugs they deserve\".He also repeated his charge that Corbyn was guilty of \"drift and dither\" over Brexit, and alleged that his stance towards Scotland threatened the integrity of the United Kingdom.The Father of the House, the pro-EU former Conservative minister Ken Clarke, challenged Johnson to provide more details over the government's \"vague aspirations\" regarding future trading relations with the EU.The prime minister replied that there would be \"zero tariffs, zero quota arrangements\" with the EU, while the UK would also be free to strike trade deals around the world.Under the UK-EU Brexit deal, once the UK leaves the EU trade negotiations would take place during a planned transition period which runs out at the end of next year. Any extension would have to be requested by the summer.Critics have questioned whether the government can achieve a frictionless trade deal with the EU, given Johnson's intention to diverge from EU rules.Tributes to Speaker John BercowSeveral politicians used the session to pay tribute to the House of Commons Speaker, John Bercow, who is standing down.Johnson aluded to Bercow's passion for tennis, while adding that he disagreed with some of his innovations.Corbyn said Bercow had stood up for parliament. Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson called him a \"modernising\" speaker who had dragged the chamber out of the past to face the future.Bercow's term is ending after 10 years in the speaker's chair. He has often been a thorn in the government's side.Recently he rejected a government move to bring a vote on its Brexit deal. In September he allowed lawmakers the chance to pass a law seeking to block a no-deal Brexit.Read more:New Year's leave?

  "text": "A leading anti-racism in football organisation has said it is \"disheartened, but not surprised\" by UEFA's sanctions against Bulgaria for the racist abuse some of the country's fans directed at black England players during the sides' Euro 2020 qualifier.Following the ruling that Bulgaria must play one home game behind closed doors and pay a fine of €75,000 for racist behaviour, a wave of criticism has been directed at UEFA for failing to tackle the issue.In a statement, Kick It Out called for UEFA to overhaul its disciplinary process in response to racism, calling the punishment a missed opportunity.  The October 14 game, which England won 6-0, had to be stopped twice in the first half due to the racist actions of some Bulgarian supporters, who were seen giving nazi salutes and making monkey noises.News of the sanctions sparked accusations that UEFA is unable to tackle racism in the game effectively.More: Bulgaria told to play match behind closed doors over fans' racist abuse of England playersCritics compared the response to the former Arsenal striker Nicolas Bendtner's £80,000 fine for displaying a sponsor on his underwear during a match.A number of football writers and pundits pointed out the lenient punishment showed why footballers may need to take action themselves by walking off the pitch in the face of racist abuse.Anti-racism charity Show Racism the Red Card tweeted: \"We want to see UEFA and domestic leagues investing more in anti-racism education programmes that can make a real difference to challenging racism in football and wider society.\"",

There is no evidence to suggest that this was possible.\"He added: \"The true culprits of the fire are those who wrapped the building in flammable cladding.\"Later, Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke about the report in the House of Commons. He said Grenfell Tower survivors and the bereaved were “overlooked and ignored” before the fire and “shamefully failed” after it.",
